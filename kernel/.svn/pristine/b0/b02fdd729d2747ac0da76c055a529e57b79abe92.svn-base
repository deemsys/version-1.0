/**
 * ResourceToolActionPipe provides a conduit through which ResourcesAction and an 
 * unknown helper may communicate about the execution of ResourceToolActions in which
 * the registered action specifies that some part of the action is handled by a helper.
 * 
 * ResourceToolActionPipe has a set of methods through which ResourcesAction can pass 
 * information to a helper about the current state of the entity (or entities?) involved 
 * in an action ("setContent", "getContent", "setMimeType", "getMimeType", etc).  It has 
 * another set of methods through which the helper passes back values that may or may 
 * not have been updated as a result of the action ("setRevisedContent", "getRevisedContent", 
 * "setRevisedMimeType", "getRevisedMimeType", etc). If a value is not changed by the action,
 * the helper should use an appropriate setter to indicate the revised value is the same
 * as the original value.  For example:
 * 
 *   pipe.setRevisedMimeType( pipe.getMimeType() );
 *   
 * Otherwise, the getter for the revised value will return null, and ResourcesAction will
 * set unset the property. ResourceToolActionPipe also has a few methods through which the 
 * helper can report whether the action was canceled or an error was encountered.  
 * 
 * @see org.sakaiproject.content.api.ResourceTypeRegistry
