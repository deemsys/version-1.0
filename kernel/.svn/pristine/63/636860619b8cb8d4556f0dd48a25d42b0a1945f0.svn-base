/**
 * The ToolURLManager interface allows creation of ToolURL that reference the portlet itself. Sakai tools assume the servlet APIs as the basis for generating markup and <br />
 * getting parameters, yet for presentation inside different portals, the URL <br />
 * encoding API javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse#encodeURL is not <br />
 * sufficient. This is because the Servlet API treats all URLs the same (hence a <br />
 * single encodeURL method), whereas portlet technologies such as JSR-168 and <br />
 * WSRP differentiate between URLs based on what they represent. There are <br />
 * primarily three different URL types as distinguished by WSRP (JSR 168 has 2, <br />
 * which is a subset of the three types distinguished by WSRP). The only <br />
 * reasonable way to allow tools to generate markup that can be presented in a <br />
 * portlet is to have the tools differentiate the URLs that are embedded in the <br />
 * markup. Some of this can be done automatically if the URLs are generated <br />
 * using macros or other APIs that allows for this differentiation to be plugged <br />
 * underneath. For instance, most of velocity based tools used different macros <br />
 * for different URL types, so it is possible to plug the appropriate URL <br />
 * encoding underneath the macros when the tool is being rendered as a portlet. <br />
 * However, tools that directly access Servlet APIs to generate markup must use <br />
 * these APIs directly. <br />
 * <br />
 * Using these APIs is simple. Instead of creating a String URL with the <br />
 * parameters, you create a ToolURL object. You must decide whether the URL type <br />
 * (render, action or resource) to create a ToolURL object. You can then set the <br />
 * request path and request parameters by using methods in ToolURL. Finally, to <br />
 * include it in the generated markup, you convert the ToolURL to a String using <br />
 * the ToolURL#toString method. <br />
