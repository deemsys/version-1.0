/**
 * This is a simple class which allows the passing of a set of search parameters in a nice way<br/>
 * Example usage:<br/>
 * <code>Search s1 = new Search("title", curTitle); // search where title equals value of curTitle</code><br/>
 * <code>Search s2 = new Search("title", curTitle, Restriction.NOT_EQUALS); // search where title not equals value of curTitle</code><br/>
 * <code>Search s2 = new Search(<br/>
 *    new Restriction("title", curTitle),<br/> 
 *    new Order("title")<br/>
 * ); // search where title equals value of curTitle and order is by title ascending</code><br/>
 * <br/>
 * Most searches can be modeled this way fairly easily. There are many constructors to make
 * it easy for a developer to write the search they want inside the search constructor.<br/>
 * There are also some methods to allow easy construction of searches in multiple steps:
 * {@link #addOrder(Order)} and {@link #addRestriction(Restriction)} allow restrictions and orders
 * to be added after the search was constructed, they will correctly handle duplicate values as well.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * There is also an option to pass a search string as well which can contain
 * formatted text to be interpreted by whatever is using the search object<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Finally, there are a few methods to make it easier to unpack and work with the search object:
 * {@link #isEmpty()} and {@link #getRestrictionByProperty(String)} and {@link #getRestrictionsProperties()}
 * make it easier to get the restriction information out of the search object
