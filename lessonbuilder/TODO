next at end of a page, maybe just general interpage links
close test and assignment at the end

I changed vm file so that LB at a site read their own .css file. I think it'd been more convenient for graphical design. 
LB have 'next' button. why not 'previous'?
Mneme has open and due for all pages.
As i wrote above It'd better to add contents inside a page. It can give user more possiblities.
