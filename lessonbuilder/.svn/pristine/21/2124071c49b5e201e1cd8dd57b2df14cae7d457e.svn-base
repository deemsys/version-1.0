If you need to add anything to the main page, you might find it useful
to know a bit more about how it works.

Lesson Builder is built around a single page, ShowPage.html, with
producer ShowPageProducer.java. Most of the functionality comes from
buttons in the toolbar, and from "edit" buttons next to items on the
page.

ShowPage is a bit complex to work with, because the actual page is
produced by the interaction of 3 different things. ShowPage.html,
ShowPageProducer.java, and show-page.js. ShowPage.html contains HTML
tmplates. ShowPageProducer has all the logic for controlling which
parts of the template are shown and adding information from the
database. show-page.js is used primarily for the popup dialogs. Even
after ShowPageProducer has filled in data from the database, many of
the dialogs have fields that are empty. The problem is that we don't
want to output a separate dialog box for each Edit Button. That would
make the HTML file too big. Thus we output just one edit dialog box
with blank fields. The Javascript code takes data from the particular
item being edited, populates the fields in the dialog box, and then
opens it.

The structure is also complicated by the fact that we have to
interface to various Sakai tools, and they all have their own
peculiarities. For that reason we have a set of classes that know
about each tool, but all implement a single Lesson Builder interface.
ShowPage only knows about that interface class. This makes it a lot
easier to add support for a new type of tool. Note that it is possible
to chain more than one class of a given type. E.g. we support both
Samigo and Mneme as testing engines. ShowPage doesn't know which
engine you're using. In fact your site can have both, and showPage
won't know it.

In general things like "Add Quiz" are buttons that call separate
pages, e.g. the quiz picker. The quiz picker looks up all quizes in
the site, lets you choose one (or call Samigo to create a new one),
and then submits to SimplePageBean to set up the new entry.
SimplePageBean will return to ShowPage after doing the change.

For editing existing items, there are buttons labelled "Edit" in the
left margin. They bring up jQuery dialogs. The dialogs are in a
section at the bottom of the page in ShowPage. However they are 
initialized and popped up by Javascript code in show-page.js.

There may be a dozen different quizes on the same page. But there is
only one actual dialog box. The specific data defining the individual
quiz is in hidden variables right after the link for the edit button. The
Javascript code for "edit quiz" is called by the edit button with a
pointer to the edit button. The Javascript uses that pointer to find
the data associated with that item, initialized all the fields in the
dialog, and then pops up the dialog.

In fact the same dialog box is used for tests and assignments, because
much of it is common. The Javascript code can hide parts of the box
that aren't relevant.

Adding something touches a number of files:
  SimplePageItem and SimplePageItemImpl to add a new item type
      and possibly new fields in the item entry.
  simplepageitem.hbm.xml if you add any fields. This is what
      Hibernate uses. Adding fields should happen autoamtically.
      However if you need to add indices, there are bugs that
      cause Hibernate not to do it, so you need to add CREATE
      INDEX statements in 
	./components/src/ddl/db2/simplepage.sql
	./components/src/ddl/hsqldb/simplepage.sql
	./components/src/ddl/mysql/simplepage.sql
	./components/src/ddl/oracle/simplepage.sql
  you may need to add a new file such as SamigoEntity.java, which
      encapsulates most of the code for talking to the Sakai tool
      that implements an object. In some cases you may also
      need to define an interface. E.g. Common Cartridge input
      calls a method to create a new object. Creating a test
      requires different arguments than creating a forum.
      Thus there's an interface definition for tests, used by
      both Samigo and Mneme. It defines the method used to
      create one. SamigoEntity.java implements both LessonEntity,
      which has most of the methods used to interface to a tool,
      and the special interface for tests, which defines the
      one method used for creating object.
      If you look at an existing file, you can see how they work.
  ShowPage.html - this is the template for the main web page.
      It goes together with ShowPageProducer, using RSF.
      It has the template for displaying each type of thing,
      as well as the dialogs.
  ShowPageProducer.java - the Java code behind ShowPage.html
  show-page.js - the Javascript used on ShowPage.html. The
      popups are produced by code here. In some cases the code
      to produce a popup is fairly complex. E.g. the same
      popup is used to edit assignments, tests, and forums.
      The Javascript code looks at hidden variables after
      the visible part of the item. They define all the
      things that the dialog box will need. The Javascript
      code gets all that data and populates the fields in
      the popup, unhides the ones that should show, and
      then creates the popup.
  Simplepagetool.css - in case you need to add any styles
  messages.properties - all text should be put in this file.
      This application is internationalized, meaning that no
      strings should be hard-coded.

Here's a walk through ShowPageProducer changes to add the forums type.
The line numbers will probably be wrong.

First, I did it by looking at all occurrences of some other object
type, I don't recall which.

At line 124 you'll see LessonEntity declarations for variables that
hold a pointer to the plugin for this object type. There can actually
be a chain, e.g. for quizes, where there are two different providers.
But ShowPageProducer doesn't know about that. It calls the first one,
which then call the next in the chain if necessary.

There are issues in copying sites. When you copy a site, the copy
operation calls code for each tool to ask it to copy all data relevant
to the tool. However there's no guarantee about what order the tools
are called. LessonBuilder may be called before forums. So the old site
may have a reference to a forum topic that hasn't yet been copied to
the new site. Thus we don't have a reference we can use. So when we
copy references to other tools, we use a special dummy reference. When
the user sees such a reference, we should a message explaining that
they need to go into the picker and pick the right item. The code at
563 checks whether a reference is dummy and adds an appropriate
message.

The large if statement starting at 601 dispatches on the item type.
For adding a new item type, you'll need to add a code to this if
statement.

Tests, assignments, and forum topics aren't shown inline in the page.
When you open a test I go to a new page and display the test in an
iframe (in order to put some navigation at the top.) If your new item
type should be shown in a separate page, you can use existing code,
and it will be quite simple to add it. If you want to display
something inline you'll have to add a new branch to the if statement,
as well as a new section to the HTML that's a template for showing the
object.

The "if (list item)" at 532 checks whether your item is one that is
displayed inline or not. The first option, starting at the text line,
is for things that are displayed on a new page. Most of that logic is
common. As explained above, the main thing that is specific to the
item type is attributes describing thatitem. E.g. for an assignment we
have to include the grading scale, because the edit item dialog needs
to know that. But that's only relevant for an assignment. So there
is code to show the attributes appropriate for the item type.

Those attributes are used in show-page.js. One of the complexities of
this code, which it's hard to avoid, is that you're juggling pure
HTML, which is generated by the template and ShowPageProducer, and
jQuery, which is in show-page.js. Take a look at the generated HTML.
You'll see that the edit buttons are a link followed by some data.
That data is picked up by the Javascript for the dialog box.

Starting at line 658 we have the code for the types that are displayed
inline. Each of those types has its own lines in the template and its
own branch of the main if statement for instantiating them.

In the case of forums there's code in makeLink, at 1135. This is the
common code that puts out the link to the page containing the item and
navigation. It's a case statement because different item types
typically require somewhat different data to find them, but the code
is fairly similar for different item types. Hence the use of a common
method. The inline types are more complex, and typically have their
own code.

setForumEntity at 1198 is the setter used by Spring to inject the
plugin for forum entities.

the line at 1244 is in createToolBar, which creates the toolbar at the
top. THere's a standard method, createToolBarLink, which can often be
used.

createEditItemDialog, starting at 1308, is used to put out the form
used for the edit dialog. Not the edit button, which is output above,
but the actual HTML code that generates the popup dialog. As explained
above, there are separate dialogs for the inline object types, because
the logic is so different. However we chose to use a single piece of
HTML for the edit dialog for all object types that call a new page,
because there are great similarities. 

One of the things that differs for different object types is the
"change" link. If you try the tool out you'll see that if you edit a
quiz, there's a link "change quiz", which ends up calling the same
page as "add quiz", to let you pick a different quiz, ie. the quiz
picker. The HTML generates links to all of these pickers. The
Javascript enables the right one when you click the edit button. Other
than that, the HTML code for that popup dialog is common. 

The Javascript code uses that HTML code as a template. It decides which
parts of the dialog should show, and fills in any variables with data
for the specific item type and item. It then pops up the dialog.
