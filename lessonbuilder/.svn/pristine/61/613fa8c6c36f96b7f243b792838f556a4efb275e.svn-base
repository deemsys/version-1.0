<h2>Adding Multimedia Content to the Page</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>NOTE: resources and multimedia are similar. Both can be either files or URLs. The 
difference is that resources appear as links in your Lesson Builder page, whereas
multimedia is displayed in a box on the page, if the student's browser is able to do this.</p>
  
  <h4><a name="6">Add Multimedia</a></h4>
<p>The multimedia option allows you to upload media files (such as videos and songs), and present them directly on the page. The Multimedia option can also double as a Web Content tool, allowing you to link to and display websites in your Lesson Builder page.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Add Multimedia</strong> button at the top of the page.</p> 

<p>You can add a multimedia file to your page by:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Clicking <strong>Browse...</strong> and locating the file on your computer. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process. The file will be added to your page and stored in the Resources tool in a folder with the same title as your Lesson Builder tool.</li>
  <li>Supplying the web address of a file in the <em>URL</em> text box. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process.</li> 
  <li>Clicking <strong>Choose Existing File</strong> to select a file that has already been uploaded to Resources. Select the file that you want to add to your page by clicking <strong>Select</strong>. Complete the process by clicking <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p> In many cases, you will need to adjust the size of the box in which the content is shown.
Use the Edit button, as explained below.

<h5><a name="6.1"> Edit Multimedia</a></h5> 

<p>To edit your multimedia content, first click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the item you would like to modify.</p> 

<p>This will open up an <em>Edit Item</em> box on your screen. The options available for modification are as follows:</p>	
<ul>
  <li><strong>Height</strong> - Change the height of the internal frame that will display your web link or contain your media. Note, you may use either percentages (%) or pixels (px) to denote either relative or absolute measurements.</li>
  <li><strong>Width</strong> - Change the width of the internal frame that will display your web link or contain your media. Note, you may use either percentages (%) or pixels (px) to denote either relative or absolute measurements.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to your multimedia file, which will appear beneath the multimedia file.</li>
  <li><strong>Change File or URL</strong> - Change the source of the media or change the URL of your web link.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
item visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>

</ul> 

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>. To remove the multimedia item from your Lesson Builder page, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

<h5><a name="3.2">Delete a Resource</a></h5>

<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the resource you would like to remove, then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>The delete function in Lesson Builder only removes the link on the Lesson Builder page.
If you would like to completely delete an uploaded file from your worksite, the file will also need to be removed from the Resources tool. To do this, click <strong>Resources</strong> on the left menu and click on the folder that has the same title as the Lesson Builder from which the file was removed. Click <strong>Actions --> Remove</strong> to the right of the file. Click <strong>Remove</strong> to complete the process.</p>
