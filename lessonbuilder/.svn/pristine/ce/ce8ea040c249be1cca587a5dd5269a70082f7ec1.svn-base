<h2> Problems with Image Size </h2>

<p> After doing <b>Add multimedia</b>, you will probably need to use
the <b>Edit</b> button to adjust the size. The size starts out
300 pixels high and the full width of the window. This size should
let you see the content, but you may need to adjust it to match the
size of your movie or Flash program.

<p>Some players will stretch or cut cut off the image if you don't set
the right size. Older copies of Windows Media Player (e.g. on Windows
XP) seem particularly prone to this. So for movies, it is safest to
adjust the size to match the actual size and shape of the movie.

<h2> Where File Uploads Go </h2>

<p>The "Upload file" feature will normally put files in a separate
folder for each instance of the tool (i.e. each button in the left
bar). If you prefer to organize the files yourself, you might prefer
to upload your file using the Resource tool and get them organized.
Then you can use "Choose Existing File" to put the file on a page.

<p> URLs are actually stored as files. URL's are stored in a subfolder
called <b> urls </b> of the unit's folder.

<h2> Accessibility </h2>

<p>If you are concerned about <b>accessibility</b> for handicapped
users, please make sure you use the <b>Edit</b> button and insert textual
descriptions for images and multimedia objects. You may want to
consider creating a separate page that presents the content in a more
accessible form and providing a link to it. One way to do this would
be using <b>Add Subpage</b>.

<h2> Helping your Users </h2>

<p> Unfortunately the ability to play movies, Flash, etc, tends to
vary from browser to browser. You may want to create a unit that
has one of each type of file you're going to use. That way students
can make sure that they have the right plugins installed at the
beginning of the course.

<h2> Problems we've seen </h2>

<ul>
<li> The Macintosh Windows Media player will sometimes give you a blank
image unless the file is public. You can set files public in the
<b>Resources</b> tool using <b>Edit Details</b>. If you have a number of files that
need to be public, you can set an entire folder public.
<p>
<li> Some players will not play content if you are using an https: URL
and the site you're pointing to does not have a proper certificate
installed.
<p>
<li> Internet Explorer will give warning messages unless all content
on the page uses https: URLs. Files that are stored on Sakai will
automatically be served with an appropriate URL, but if you define
any URLs for yourself, you shold be careful about this.
<p>
<li> With Safari on the Macintosh, if you edit a Youtube video, and
change the URL, when the page updates the player isn't there. If you
refresh the page it works fine. Everything works fine for normal
users.
<p>
<li> On Windows, users may need to adjust the secuity settings in
Internet Explorer. For some player types, Active X needs to be
enabled. You may not get any sign that this is the problem with IE,
just an empty box where your content should be.
<p>
<li> If a plugin needs to talk to the user, it may fail. E.g. after
installing Acrobat, the first time you run Acrobat, you need to accept
the license. With Firefox you are prompted to do this. With Internet
Explorer, it simply gives you an empty box where your content should
be.
