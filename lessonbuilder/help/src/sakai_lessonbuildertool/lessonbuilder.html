			<h4><a name="1">1. Introduction</a></h4>
			<p>Lesson Builder is a tool that allows an instructor to organize resources, quizzes, tests, and media on a single page. You can have as many Lesson Builder pages in your site as you see fit. Each Lesson Builder page can be customized to suit the needs of the lesson by taking some of the tools available in Sakai and putting them onto a single page. You can add assignments, tests, resources, text, links, images, discussion forums and other pieces of media to a Lesson Builder page.</p>
