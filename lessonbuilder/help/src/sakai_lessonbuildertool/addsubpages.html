<h2>Adding Additional Pages</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<h4><a name="7">7. Add Subpages</a></h4>
<p>Each Lesson Builder tool that you add to your worksite can have multiple pages associated with it. These pages are referred to as subpages.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Add Subpage</strong> button at the top of the page. Fill in the text field labeled <em>Page title</em> with the title of your new subpage and click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>

<p>This will take you to a blank Lesson Builder page, where you can add new content pieces as you see fit.</p>

<p> Normally the page appears "under" the page you started from. That is, when you go to the subpage,
you'll see the name of the original page at the top. Normally readers will expect to go back to the
original page when they are finished. </p>

<p> However it is possible to string together lists of pages, so that each leads you to the next.
In that case, the previous pages do not show at the top, and there's no expectation that readers
will return to the original page (although they can do so with "Back"). To string together pages,
when you create a subpage, check the "Next Page" checkbox for each new page. You may also prefer
to check "Show as button." </p>

<h5><a name="7.1"> Edit a Subpage</a></h5> 

<p>To edit information about a subpage, click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the subpage you would like to modify.</p> 

<p>The options available for modification are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Item Name</strong> - Change the name of the text of the link to your subpage on the main Lesson Builder page.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to the subpage, which will appear beneath the link to the subpage.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Page</strong> - Change the subpage being linked to.</li>
  <li><strong>Next page, i.e. page replaces the current one rather than returning to the current one.</strong> This is explained above.</li>
  <li><strong>Show as button rather than link</strong></li> - This is a cosmetic option to have your subpage appear as a button rather than a link in your Lesson Builder plan.
  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like it to appear/be accessible only after previously 'Required' items have been completed/accessed.</li>
  <li><strong>Require This Item </strong>- Select this option to make this item a 'Required' item for later on in the Lesson Builder plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
page visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.

</ul>

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>. To remove the subpage from your page, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
