<h2>Add Forum Topics to a Page</h2>

<p>Click the <strong>Add Forum Topic</strong> button at the top of the page. This will give you a list of forum topics already created in your 
forum tool. Click the one you wish to add and then click <strong>Use Selected Item</strong>.</p>

<p>To create a new topic, use the link <strong>Create new topic</strong> at the top of the page. If you have more

This will call the forum tool, and allow you to create a new topic or modify an existing one. When you are 
ready to add the new topic, click the <strong>Continue with Add Forum Topic</strong> button at the top. That will return you to
the list of topics, where you can choose the topic you just created.</p>

<p> Note that only topics may be added. Depending upon the tool, topics are contained within categories or forums. 
Categories and forums may not be added, just actual topics.</p>

  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this topic should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
topic visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>
