<h2>Restricting access to published
assessments</h2>
 

<p>You cannot modify the "Assessment Released To" setting of a published
assessment, but you can remove a published assessment, modify the
settings in the pending assessment, and publish it
again. To remove a published assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting or removing an assessment</a>. To change the settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing a published assessment deletes all 
student submissions and the corresponding gradebook item.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify the unpublished version under "Pending Assessments", you'll have to
alter the assessment's name before republishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>Also, if you modify the settings of a test while students are taking
it, the changes will not affect testing sessions in progress.
Students must exit the test and re-enter it in order to have the
modified settings take effect.</p>
