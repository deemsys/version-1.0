<h2>Basic LTI: Overview</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Sakai Basic LTI tool 
allows you to include tools that support the
IMS Basic Learning Tools Interoperability standard
in your sites.
The Basic LTI launch protocol securely sends
user, site, and role information to the external tool
using the OAuth (www.oauth.net) security
mechanism.</p>
<p>
The site owner or the system administrator can 
configure a Basic LTI tool. 
If the system administrator
pre-configures a Basic LTI tool, it appears in the list of tools
like any other tool that can be added to the site
by the site owner.</p>
<h3>Tool Configuration</h3>
<p>
If the system administrator gives the site owner
access to an unconfigured Basic LTI tool, 
a site owner can set up a link to any external tool
they like.   When you make arrangements with an external tool
provider, they will provide you with 
a <strong>launch URL</strong> for the tool, 
<strong>key</strong>, and a <strong>secret</strong>.   These values
must be entered 
as part of the configuration of the tool.
Make sure not to reveal these values to the other members of the site.  
Once you have entered these values into the tool, it can properly sign
launch requests.  Site members who are not site owners cannot see the
configuration screen for the tool.
</p>
<p>
The Basic LTI configuration also includes the ability to send or
suppress user identity information to the external tool such as the 
user's name or E-mail address.  In addition, you can set the frame size,
as well as the button and title text for the tool from the configuration
screen.  If the tool you are working with was created by a system
administrator, they may have already pre-configured and locked a 
number of the configuration options for the tool.</p>
