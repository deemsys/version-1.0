<h2>Basic Search</h2>
<p>
On the Search page, enter the words that you want to search for in the entry box.
The search tool will search for one or more of those terms.
</p>
<p>
Search will only return items from the current worksite or course.
The results are ranked according to a relevance score. This score is based on
the proximity of the words, and the frequency of the words within the content. 
If there are more than 10 results, the results will be paged, and you can browse through the 
pages by selecting the page number to view.
</p>
<p>
The search tool performs some basic analysis on the words you enter. For example, it will ignore
frequently occurring terms like <em>I</em> or <em>the</em> and will reduce words to their stem word.
</p>
<blockquote>
For example, if you search
for <em>cowslips</em>, the search tool will recognise the stem of the word as <em>cowslip</em> and search for all words with that stem,
i.e. <em>cowslip, cowslips</em>. 
</blockquote>
<p>
To improve search accuracy, you can prefix terms with + or -, indicating the search <em>must contain</em> or <em>must not contain</em> the 
term which follows.
<blockquote>
For example if you search for <em>+cowslips -bluebells</em>, 	
the search will return results which contain the stem <em>cowslip</em> and do not contain the stem <em>bluebell</em>.
