<h2>Reading announcements</h2>
<p>You can view announcements from all sites in My Workspace, or from
individual sites:</p>

<h3>My Workspace</h3>

<p>From <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can view a consolidated list of
announcements from all your sites. Enter My Workspace, and from the
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>. To read an announcement, click
its title.  </p>

<p>Also, on the Home page of My Workspace, you'll find a "Recent
Announcements" section listing the most current announcements from
your sites.</p>

<h3>Individual sites</h3>


<p>You can read announcements within each site to which you
belong. Enter a site, and from the menubar, click
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>. To read an announcement, click its title.</p>

<p>Also, on the Home page of the site, you'll find a "Recent
Announcements" section listing the most current announcements of the
site.</p>


<p>You can sort the announcements list by clicking on any of the column
headings (e.g., <strong><code>Subject</code></strong>, <strong><code>Modified</code></strong> <strong><code>Date</code></strong>, etc.) to sort
by that column.  Clicking the same heading again will reverse the
sorting order.</p>
