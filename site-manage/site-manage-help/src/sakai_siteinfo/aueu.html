<h2>Tools for managing site communication</h2>
<a name="top"> </a>

<p>Two distinct tools, Email Archive and Messages, are available for
managing communication between site participants, while the
Announcements tool is useful for one-way communication.  Additionally,
other site tools allow you to send email notifications to participants
when you add new items.  </p>

<a name="ea"> </a><h3>Email Archive</h3>

<p>Each site participant can use the <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardh">Email Archive</a> to mail all site participants at once. You cannot use it to
send mail to an individual or a group within the site.</p>

<p>You send messages using your email account, and recipients receive
messages in their email accounts. Copies of messages are kept in the
Email Archive tool.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="messages"> </a><h3>Messages</h3>

<p>All site participants can use <a href="content.hlp?docId=avao">Messages</a> to
send messages to one or more site participants, a defined group, all
participants with a certain role, or all site participants at once.</p>

<p>Site participants can choose to have all of their messages for
a particular site automatically delivered to their preferred email
address; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=bcpl">Modifying settings in Messages</a>.</p>

<p>Users with an administrative role (instructors, assistants, and
project owners) can determine the options available for sending a copy
of a message to the email addresses of all recipients, even those who
have not chosen to have all of their messages forwarded; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=bcpl">Modifying settings in Messages</a>.</p>

<p>A copy of the message will always go to each recipient's <code>Received</code>
folder in Messages, as well as to email, if applicable.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot reply to Messages from the forwarded
email messages; to reply, go to the Messages tool in your site.</p>

<a name="announce"> </a><h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>You can use <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyk">Announcements</a> to send a
one-way communication to your entire site or to a defined group.</p>

<p>All announcements are stored in your site's Announcements tool, and
will appear in Announcements in each participant's <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a> site.  Additionally, if you set the <strong><code>Email
Notification</code></strong> option to <strong><code>High - All participants</code></strong>, your
announcement will be sent directly to all participants' email
addresses.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="notify"> </a><h3>Email notification</h3>

<p>Some tools (e.g., Announcements, Resources, and Syllabus) allow you
to send email notifications to site participants when you add new
items. You can specify a low-priority email notification, which will
be subject to each participant's notification preferences, or high
priority, which will override individually set preferences so that all
site participants receive the notification.</p>
