<h2>Email: Overview</h2>
<p> Email allows user to send an email message to site particpants. Also it provides WYSIWYG editing, file attachment, group/section-aware recipient selection, and a field for specifying non-site participant email addresses. </p>
<h3> Compose </h3>
<p> On the <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=mailsender_content2">Compose</a> page, you can select recipient(s) from the pre-configured recipient view. If you want to send a copy to non-site-participant, enter the recipent's email address in the &quot;Other recipient(s)&quot; text field. If you want to attach file(s), click &quot;Attach a file&quot; to browse for a file on your computer. Enter a subject and a message. If the WYSIWYG editor is configured, you should be able to type messages using HTML formatting options. Finally check &quot;Send me a copy&quot; and &quot;Append to Email Archive&quot; if desired. <br>
  Note: File attachments will not be archived in Email Archive. Only the attachment details (file name and size) will be recorded. </p>
<h3> Options </h3>
<p> NOTE: To complete the procedures on the Options page, you must be assigned a role with the necessary permissions. To determine your role, follow the directions in Participant Roles. For a basic understanding of roles and permissions, see Permissions and Roles Overview. </p>
<p> On the <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=mailsender_content3">Options</a> page, you can set Email defaults for the site: recipient view, send me a copy, Add to Email Archive, reply-to, and message format. (Also, only when sakai.properties has &quot;mailsender.show.renaming.roles=true&quot;, the allowed role can rename the role names.) </p>
