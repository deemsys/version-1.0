<h2>Forums: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>


<p>The Forums tool allows instructors or site leaders to create an
unlimited number of discussion forums, and is integrated closely with
other tools such as <a href="content.hlp?docId=arfs">Resources</a> and <a href="content.hlp?docId=arge">Gradebook</a>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Forums vs. topics:</strong> A forum is a mandatory category or
grouping for topics.  Topics, which are created within forums, are
where participants can post conversations.  A forum with the name of
the site and a topic titled "General Discussion" are created by
default.</p>

<p><strong>Conversations:</strong> A conversation is the thread of
messages in which participants post their contributions. A
conversation can be created by instructors or students inside of a
topic.</p>

<p><strong>Grading option:</strong> Interactions can be assigned a point
value and sent to the Gradebook with comments.</p>

<p><strong>Counts of unread posts at a glance:</strong> On your site's
Home page (select <strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>), you
can see how many unread messages or posts you have in both Messages
and Forums.  From <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can see these totals
for all sites you're a member of.</p>

<p><strong>Email notifications:</strong> Site members can elect to
receive no email notification, notification for all new postings in a
site, or notification for responses to  conversations they've posted in. The default is to receive notifications
about new postings in conversations you have contributed
to.</p>

<p><strong>Composing messages:</strong> A rich-text interface allows rich
text, plain text, and HTML editing. You can add attachments
to any message by linking to files or web links in Resources.  See <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">The rich-text editor</a>.</p>

 


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pasting text into the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">rich-text editor</a>
should preserve most formatting, but some types of formatting, such as
colored text, may need to be added manually in the editor after pasting.</p>


<p><strong>Quoted text:</strong> Use the <strong><code>Insert Original Text</code></strong>
option to insert the previous post into your response.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics:</strong> Forum statistics are available for
site owners to determine the participation level of individual
participants.  You can also read all of a particular participant's
posts using this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Settings:</strong> The site owner (or another participant
with the appropriate role) can enable participants to submit their
posts to a topic before they have permission to read the responses of
others.</p>

<p><strong>Group awareness:</strong> Site leaders can change forum and
topic settings in combination with predefined groups to allow or deny
access to specific discussions per group.</p>

<p><strong>Direct link to individual messages:</strong> Site leaders
can copy a direct link to individual messages to use elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Email the author of a message:</strong> Site leaders can
directly email the author of a posting from within the forum tool.</p>
