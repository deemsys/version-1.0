This is the Maven project for the custom JSF widgets.  
The widgets and the resources projects are closely tied together.
These widgets will be deployed as a jar file containing Sakai JSF widgets (components).  
Web applications can include this jar in order to use the Sakai JSF widgets in a JSF tool.
