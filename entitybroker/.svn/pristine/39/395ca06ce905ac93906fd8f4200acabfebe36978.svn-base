 * normally {@link CollectionResolvable} should show all entities, however, for the browse list
 * we will explicitly filter by users and/or locations and may not show all entities,
 * entities which do not implement this or {@link BrowseableCollection} will not appear in lists of entities which are being browsed<br/>
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
