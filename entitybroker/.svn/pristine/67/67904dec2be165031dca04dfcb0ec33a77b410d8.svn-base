/**
 * This annotation indicates that this method is a custom action from {@link ActionsExecutable},
 * this should not be placed on any methods defined by a capability but should be placed on methods
 * which you want to be exposed as custom actions<br/>
 * By default the name of the method is used as the action key and this will work for read requests 
 * (viewKey is set to {@link EntityView#VIEW_SHOW}), 
 * you can add in action and viewKey annotation params to change those settings<br/>
 * You can describe this action using the key: <prefix>.action.<actionKey> = description<br/>
 * The methods annotated by this can have the following argument (parameter) types: <br/>
 * (type => data which will be given to the method) <br/>
 * {@link EntityView} : the current entity view for this request (contains extension, url, segments) <br/>
 * {@link EntityReference} : the current entity reference (prefix and optional id) <br/>
 * {@link String} : entity prefix <br/>
 * {@link Search} : the search object based on the incoming params <br/>
 * {@link OutputStream} : stream to place outbound data (probably binary) into for transmission <br/>
 * {@link Map} ({@link String} => {@link Object}) : a map of the actions parameters (params from the action request) <br/>
 * <br/>
 * These methods should return one of the following: <br/>
 * 1) null (this is ok in most circumstances to indicate the method is done, use an exception to indicate failure) <br/>
 * 2) an {@link ActionReturn} (this is a special object used to indicate return states and handle binary data) <br/>
 * 3) an {@link EntityData} (this is a special object used to wrap the object and provide meta data) <br/>
 * 4) a UTF-8 encoded OutputStream or String <br/>
 * 5) a List of entity objects <br/>
 * 6) an entity object <br/>
 * 7) a boolean value (true indicates success and is the same as returning null, false indicates failure and causes an {@link EntityNotFoundException} <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Can throw the following exceptions and have them translated and handled, all others will pass through:<br/>
 * {@link EntityNotFoundException} to indicate the entity request could not find the data that was requested <br/>
 * {@link IllegalArgumentException} to indicate that the incoming params or the request was invalid <br/>
 * {@link FormatUnsupportedException} to indicate that the requested format is not supported for this entity request <br/>
 * {@link EntityException} to indicate a specific entity failure occurred, can include a response code and error message <br/>
 * {@link SecurityException} to indicate that the the current user is no allowed to perform this action <br/>
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} to indicate that the current action being requested is invalid (typically indicates bad combination of viewKey and action) <br/>
 * {@link IllegalStateException} to indicate a general failure has occurred <br/>
 * <br/>
