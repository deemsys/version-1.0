 * Usage:<br/> 1) Implement this interface<br/> 2) Implement any additional capabilities
 * interfaces (optional, but it would be crazy not to do at least one)<br/> 3) Create a spring bean
 * definition in the Sakai application context (components.xml)<br/> 4) Implement
 * {@link AutoRegisterEntityProvider} or register this implementation some other way
