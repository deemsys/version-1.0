/**
 * Indicates that this entity provider will handle its own entity view requests,
 * this would be very unusual but it allows the entity provider itself to redirect
 * requests to a tool and normally would be used if there is some special circumstance only<br/>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This will be called before any other request handling and before the access provider
 * is called and will cause all other processing to be skipped (includes REST calls, custom actions, formatting, etc.)<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> if you want to stop certain requests from coming through then
 * a better option is to use {@link RequestInterceptor} which is triggered
 * just before this would be called
