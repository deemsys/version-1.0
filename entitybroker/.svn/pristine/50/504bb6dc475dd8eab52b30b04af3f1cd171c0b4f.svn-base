/**
 * Stub class to make it possible to test the {@link Describeable} capabilities, will perform like the

 * NOTE: This MUST use "describe-prefix" as the prefix<br/>
 * Will perform all {@link CRUDable} operations also<br/>
 * Returns {@link MyEntity} objects<br/>
 * Allows for testing {@link Resolvable} and {@link CollectionResolvable} as well, returns 3 {@link MyEntity} objects 
 * if no search restrictions, 1 if "stuff" property is set, none if other properties are set
