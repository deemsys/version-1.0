 * This entity type has the ability to define and handle configurable URLs<br/>

 * /gradebook/7890/student/70987 to view all the grades for a student from a course <br/>
 * /gradebook/6758/item/Quiz1 to view a particular item in a gradebook by it's human readable name <br/>
 * /gradebook/item/6857657 to maybe just a view an item by its unique id. <br/>
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
 * The convention interface is at {@link Redirectable}, there is also a capability
 * for handling simple redirects at {@link RedirectDefinable}
