/**
 * Allows entities handled by the entity provider which implements this interface to have meta properties
 * attached to them, properties can be accessed via the {@link EntityBroker}, properties will be
 * stored and retrieved using the internal entity property retrieval implementation<br/>
 * For our usage, meta properties are extra or additional properties that are attached to an entity
 * at runtime but are persisted so they can be retrieved later<br/>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> this should be used only for properties of entities which will be accessed very
 * lightly, for production level access OR the ability to control how properties are stored on your
 * own entities, you should use the {@link PropertyProvideable} instead <br/>
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
