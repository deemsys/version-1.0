/**
 * This indicates that this entity will participate in browse functionality for entities,
 * For example, it will provide lists of entities which are visible to users in locations
 * which can be looked through and selected<br/>
 * Entities which do not implement this will not appear in lists of entities which are being browsed<br/>
 * This is the convention interface and simply uses the results of calls to {@link CollectionResolvable} to
 * provide lists of entities for browsing, the implementor should be sure that ordering and limiting are supported
 * for the provided search object in their implementation of 
 * {@link CollectionResolvable#getEntities(org.sakaiproject.entitybroker.EntityReference, org.sakaiproject.entitybroker.entityprovider.search.Search)}<br/>
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
 * See {@link Browseable} for the i18n keys <br/>
 * This extends {@link CollectionResolvable}, use the {@link BrowseSearchable} interface if you require more control
