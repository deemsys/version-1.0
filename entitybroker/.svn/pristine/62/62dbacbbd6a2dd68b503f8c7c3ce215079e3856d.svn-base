/**
 * This entity supports custom actions (as defined by RoR and REST microformat:
 * http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/urls)<br/>
 * This means that there are custom actions which can be invoked on entities or entity spaces,
 * custom actions can augment the current entity operation or they can completely
 * change the behavior and skip the current operation entirely<br/>
 * You can create methods in your entity provider which either end with {@value #ACTION_METHOD_SUFFIX}
 * or use the {@link EntityCustomAction} suffix to define the custom actions<br/>
 * You can describe the actions using the {@link Describeable} key: <prefix>.action.<actionKey> = description<br/>
 * If you want more control then you can use {@link ActionsDefineable} and {@link ActionsExecutionControllable}<br/>
 * @see EntityCustomAction for more details about the custom action methods
