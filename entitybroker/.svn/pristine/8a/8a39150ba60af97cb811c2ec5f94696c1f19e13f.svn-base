/**
 * Allows entities handled by the entity provider which implements this interface to have meta properties
 * attached to them, these properties can be accessed via the {@link EntityBroker}, properties will be
 * stored and retrieved via the methods which are implemented in this interface<br/> 
 * For our usage, meta properties are extra or additional properties that are attached to an entity
 * at runtime but are persisted so they can be retrieved later<br/>
 * Allows the entity provider to define and control the way properties are stored on its own entities,
 * if you would prefer to use the internal storage and only have lightweight property storage needs
 * then use {@link Propertyable} instead<br/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> the validity of references and parameters is checked in the broker before the call
 * goes to the provider <br/> 
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
