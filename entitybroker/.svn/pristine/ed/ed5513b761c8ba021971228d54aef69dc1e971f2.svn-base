 * Allows a bean to report the classloader that is appropriate for it and will be used

 * are using a proxied bean or the implementation class is in the wrong classloader<br/>
 * This is primarily used in the case of the {@link HttpServletAccessProvider}
 * or {@link EntityViewAccessProvider} 
 * and the implementations of those should also implement this interface 
 * to be able to specify the classloader
