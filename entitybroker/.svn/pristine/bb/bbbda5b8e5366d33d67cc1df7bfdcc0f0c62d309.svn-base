/**
 * This is the base unit for working with Sakai entities, by implementing this interface and
 * creating a spring bean you will tie your entities into Sakai, there are many other interfaces
 * which you can implement to extend the interaction of your entities with Sakai in this package<br/>
 * You (the implementor) will want to create one implementation of this interface for each type of
 * entity you want to link to Sakai to track events, provide URL access, etc.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Usage:<br/>
 * 1) Implement this interface<br/> 
 * 2) Implement any additional capabilities interfaces (optional)<br/>
 * 3) Create a spring bean definition in the Sakai application context (components.xml)<br/> 
 * 4) Implement {@link AutoRegisterEntityProvider} or register this implementation some other way<br/>
 * <br/> 
 * Recommended best practices: (example: Thing entity)<br/> 
 * 1) Create an interface called
 * ThingEntityProvider which extends {@link EntityProvider} in api logic (add an entity package for
 * it), (e.g. org.sakaiproject.evaluation.logic.entity.EvaluationEntityProvider.java) <br/> 
 * 2) Add a public static string which contains the entity prefix (called ENTITY_PREFIX), (e.g. public final
 * static String ENTITY_PREFIX = "eval-evaluation";) <br/> 
 * 3) Implement your ThingEntityProvider in
 * impl logic as ThingEntityProviderImpl (add an entity package for it), (e.g.
 * org.sakaiproject.evaluation.logic.impl.entity.EvaluationEntityProviderImpl.java) <br/> 
 * 4) Implement {@link CoreEntityProvider} in ThingEntityProviderImpl <br/> 
 * 5) Implement {@link AutoRegisterEntityProvider} in ThingEntityProviderImpl <br/> 
 * 6) Add a spring bean
 * definition in the Sakai application context (components.xml), use the api name as the id<br/>
 * Example: <xmp> <bean id="org.sakaiproject.evaluation.logic.entity.EvaluationEntityProvider"
 * class="org.sakaiproject.evaluation.logic.impl.entity.EvaluationEntityProviderImpl"> </bean>
 * </xmp> <br/> 
 * 7) Add the needed maven dependendencies to api/logic and impl/logic project.xml
 * files<br/> 
 * Exmaple: <xmp> 
 * <dependency> 
 *    <groupId>sakaiproject</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>sakai-entitybroker-api</artifactId> 
 *    <version>${sakai.version}</version>
 * </dependency> 
 * </xmp> <br/> 
 * That should do it. You should now be able to use the
 * {@link EntityBroker} to access information about your entities and register events for your
 * entities (among other things).
