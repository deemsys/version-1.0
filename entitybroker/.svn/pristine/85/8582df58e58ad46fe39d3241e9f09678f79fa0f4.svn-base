/**
 * This indicates that this entity will participate in browse functionality for entities,
 * For example, it will provide lists of entities which are visible to users in locations
 * which can be looked through and selected<br/>
 * This is the root interface for browsing entities and does not do anything by itself,
 * you must add at least {@link BrowseableCollection} or {@link BrowseSearchable} interface to this <br/>
 * If your entities are nested then the nested ones will need to implement {@link BrowseNestable} <br/>
 * Entities which do not implement this will not appear in lists of entities which are being browsed <br/>
 * Internationalization keys:<br/>
 * {prefix}.browse = the name to show in the browse list for this entity <br/>
 * {prefix}.browse.description = the optional description that is viable to show in the browse list for this entity <br/>
 * <br/>
 * This is one of the capability extensions for the {@link EntityProvider} interface<br/>
