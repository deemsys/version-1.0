/**
 * This allows a developer to be notified whenever a provider is registered,
 * it will also ensure that it calls the listener method for any providers that are already registered
 * when it is first registered if desired<br/>
 * Usage:<br/>
 * Just implement this class and use {@link EntityProviderManager#registerNotifier(EntityProviderNotifier)} to
 * register it with the system. Whenever an entity provider is registered the {@link #run(EntityProvider)} method
 * is called. You can limit the calls to your listener using the {@link #getPrefixFilter()} and {@link #getCapabilityFilter()}.<br/>
 * Note that you can return a null prefix filter and capability filter but it means you will get called for
 * every registration of every provider. You will want to use the {@link EntityProvider} for the generics
 * to receive every capability type.<br/>
